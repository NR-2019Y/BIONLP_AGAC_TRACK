Increased or ectopic PDGF activity may also cause or contribute to diseases such as cancer and tissue fibrosis. Until recently, no loss-of-function (LOF) mutations in PDGF or PDGF receptor genes were reported as causally linked to a human disease. This changed in 2013 when reports appeared on presumed LOF mutations in the genes encoding PDGF-B and its receptor PDGF receptor-beta (PDGF-R\u03b2) in familial idiopathic basal ganglia calcification (IBGC), a brain disease characterized by anatomically localized calcifications in or near the blood microvessels. Here, we review PDGF-B and PDGF-R\u03b2 biology with special reference to their functions in brain-blood vessel development, pericyte recruitment and the regulation of the blood-brain barrier. We also discuss various scenarios for IBGC pathogenesis suggested by observations in patients and genetically engineered animal models of the disease.", "project": "AGAC_sample", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 464, "end": 473}, "obj": "Var"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 477, "end": 481}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 649, "end": 653}, "obj": "Gene"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 987, "end": 1007}, "obj": "CPA"}]}
