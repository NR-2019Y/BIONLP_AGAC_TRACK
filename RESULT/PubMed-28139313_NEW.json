Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation has been attempted in severely affected patients, but outcomes have been poor.\nOBJECTIVE: We sought to define the effect of increased STAT1 activity on T helper cell polarization and to investigate the therapeutic potential of ruxolitinib in treating autoimmunity secondary to STAT1 GOF mutations.\nMETHODS: We used in\u00a0vitro polarization assays, as well as phenotypic and functional analysis of STAT1-mutated patient cells.\nRESULTS: We report a child with a novel mutation in the linker domain of STAT1 who had life-threatening autoimmune cytopenias and chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis. Naive lymphocytes from the affected patient displayed increased TH1 and follicular T helper cell and suppressed TH17\u00a0cell responses. The mutation augmented cytokine-induced STAT1 phosphorylation without affecting dephosphorylation kinetics. Treatment with the Janus kinase 1/2 inhibitor ruxolitinib reduced hyperresponsiveness to type I and II interferons, normalized TH1 and follicular T helper cell responses, improved TH17 differentiation, cured mucocutaneous candidiasis, and maintained remission of immune-mediated cytopenias.\nCONCLUSIONS: Autoimmunity and infection caused by STAT1 GOF mutations are the result of dysregulated T helper cell responses. Janus kinase inhibitor therapy could represent an effective targeted treatment for long-term disease control in severely affected patients for whom hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is not available.", "project": "AGAC_sample", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 161, "end": 177}, "obj": "PosReg"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 200, "end": 216}, "obj": "PosReg"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 223, "end": 232}, "obj": "Var"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 615, "end": 624}, "obj": "PosReg"}, {"id": "T5", "span": {"begin": 625, "end": 639}, "obj": "MPA"}, {"id": "T6", "span": {"begin": 1216, "end": 1224}, "obj": "Var"}, {"id": "T7", "span": {"begin": 1225, "end": 1234}, "obj": "PosReg"}, {"id": "T8", "span": {"begin": 1235, "end": 1273}, "obj": "MPA"}]}
