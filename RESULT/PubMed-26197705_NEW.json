Upon activation by \u03b1-melanocyte stimulating hormone, MC1R triggers the cAMP cascade to stimulate eumelanogenesis. We used whole-exome sequencing to identify causative alleles in Pakistani families with skin and hair hypopigmentation. Six MC1R mutations segregated with the phenotype in seven families, including a p.Val174del in-frame deletion and a p.Tyr298* nonsense mutation, that were analyzed for function in heterologous HEK293 cells. p.Tyr298* MC1R showed no agonist-induced signaling to the cAMP or ERK pathways, nor detectable agonist binding. Conversely, signaling was comparable for p.Val174del and wild-type in HEK cells overexpressing the proteins, but binding analysis suggested impaired cell surface expression. Flow cytometry and confocal imaging studies revealed reduced plasma membrane expression of p.Val174del and p.Tyr298*. Therefore, p.Tyr298* was a total loss-of-function (LOF) allele, while p.Val174del displayed a partial LOF attribute.", "project": "AGAC_sample", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 636, "end": 654}, "obj": "Var"}, {"id": "T2", "span": {"begin": 1120, "end": 1129}, "obj": "Var"}, {"id": "T3", "span": {"begin": 1164, "end": 1180}, "obj": "NegReg"}, {"id": "T4", "span": {"begin": 1233, "end": 1236}, "obj": "NegReg"}]}
