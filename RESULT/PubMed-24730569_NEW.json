We report on the DNA damage response (DDR) of human melanocytes to UV and its enhancement by \u03b1-MSH. \u03b1-MSH up-regulated the levels of XPC, the enzyme that recognizes DNA damage sites, enhanced the UV-induced phosphorylation of the DNA damage sensors ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related (ATR) and ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and their respect-ive substrates checkpoint kinases 1 and 2, and increased phosphorylated H2AX (\u03b3H2AX) formation. These effects required functional MC1R and were absent in melanocytes expressing loss of function (LOF) MC1R. The levels of wild-type p53-induced phosphatase 1 (Wip1), which dephosphorylates \u03b3H2AX, correlated inversely with \u03b3H2AX. We propose that \u03b1-MSH increases UV-induced \u03b3H2AX to facilitate formation of DNA repair complexes and repair of DNA photoproducts, and LOF of MC1R compromises the DDR and genomic stability of melanocytes.", "project": "AGAC_sample", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 823, "end": 839}, "obj": "NegReg"}]}
