Conditioned medium from PBMC was obtained in fasting (PBMC-CM-F) and 4-h postprandial (PBMC-CM-PP) states. PBMC-CM-PP from non-variant controls inhibited adipogenesis of human preadipocytes more than did PBMC-CM-F. In contrast, PBMC-CM-F or -PP from PCSK9 LOF variant subjects had no effect on adipogenesis. After the oral fat load, PBMC from PCSK9 LOF variant subjects showed significant increases in mRNA levels of interleukin-1\u03b2, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c, CD36, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), only MCP-1 mRNA levels increased in PBMC from non-variant controls.\nCONCLUSIONS: The absence of anti-adipogenic action of PBMC from PCSK9 LOF variant subjects points to a novel role for PCSK9 in PBMC-adipose cell interactions.", "project": "AGAC_sample", "denotations": [{"id": "T1", "span": {"begin": 234, "end": 250}, "obj": "NegReg"}]}
